#TDD and Unit Testing
TDD is to keep the code maintainable. Also reduces technical debt

### TDD 
What is it?
How do you implement it. ALWAYS write the test before starting the code.

### Unit testing
What is it?
What are the benefits:

### Tools for python

### Unittest
Unittest comes with python(standard). Requires you to import it and self.Assert(x) rather than just assert which can be used in pytest.

### Pytest
Pytest needs to be installed with package, however it is clean and efficient. 
pytest -v is 'verbose' meaning it will be vocal about the results of the test and give us more feedback
pytest looks for the relevant file_name, and class name, has the syntax test_(characters) or (characters_test)
